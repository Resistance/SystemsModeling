### Use Cases
- single unit of meaningful work
- high-level view of behavior observable to someone or something outside the system
- Use-case description
  - Name
  - Small (abstract) textual description
  - List of Stakeholders (actors), Requirements, Constraints, Formal description of flow of events
  - Collection of User-Stories
		


### User Stories
  - Very concrete example of the problem to solve (assume the development project already exists)
  - Very short (less than half a page)
  - Write down as: Title, Pre condition, Action (<3 sentences), Post condition

  - classes: turn, hole(par.: amount - num. of beans, position - which slot), player

  1 (First) game starts - default setting
  2 second game after winning - winner starts as the first player
  3 only putting beans to own holes                – Alice, 5 beans from a1 => a2, a3, a4, a5, a6
  4 last bean reaches pot, Alice gets another turn – Alice, 2 beans from a5 => a6, A
  5 beans end in own area                          – Alice, 9 beans from a6 => A, b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, b6, B, a1
  6 last bean ends in empty hole, captures opposing beans
  7 no more seeds on Alice's side, end game (game end, when one player wins)
  8 bean ends in opponent hole
  9 closing the program - confirmation if ongoing game
 10 aborting the game/restarting from beginning
 11 game ends in draw
 12 open game - starting the program
 13 turn changes from player A to player B - buttons activate/change
 14 click history button - opens another window 
 15 close history window
 16 enter player names and okey
 17 enter player names and press cancel
